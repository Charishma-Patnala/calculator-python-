Simple CLI Calculator
A straightforward, command-line interface (CLI) calculator built with Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in an interactive and user-friendly way.
âœ¨ Features
Basic Arithmetic: Supports Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
Interactive Menu: A clear and easy-to-navigate menu for selecting operations.
Robust Error Handling: Gracefully handles invalid inputs (like text instead of numbers) and mathematical errors (like division by zero).
Clean Code: Uses a dictionary to map user choices to functions, making the code scalable and easy to read.
User-Friendly Exit: Allows the user to quit the application cleanly at any time.
ðŸ“‹ Requirements
Python 3.x
No external libraries are needed to run this program.
